Raspberry Pi Sense HAT data viewer using WebSocket to retrieve sensor data.

I will leave two branch as a basic example and I will continue to update the master branch instead.

Branches available:

- ``basic`` This is the first iteration with only jquery mobile
- ``basic_with_angularjs`` This version has been implemented with angularjs and jquery mobile

The WebSocket is created with Node-RED and the data logger is a Python script, 
I will leave their implementation files for more understanding.
I might write some tutorial about them later.
